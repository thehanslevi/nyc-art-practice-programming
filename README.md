## Why I built it

I wanted a personalized instrument for moving through the artworld and my own art practice in New York.

## What it is

- A weekly calendar of events across media and venues including theatre, dance, film, music, workshops, readings, and more.
- Two modes: **Make** (classes and workshops) and **Witness** (shows and screenings).
- A picks / shortlist system with passphrase-based cross-device sync — star on your phone, see it on your laptop.
- A self-updating ICS feed.

## What it does

- **Groups events by week, one week at a time by default.** auto-focuses on the current week; arrows to move; jump-to-week dropdown.
- **Every event carries structured metadata:** category, mode, start / end time, category-color left border.
- **Weekly summary strip:** event count, cost range, making %, picked count and cost.
- **Past events dim and hide by default** with a "show past" toggle.
- **Places to make / see things:** comprehensive list of venues also provided as an ongoing resource, collapsed below the calendar.
- **Cross-device picks sync via Supabase**, keyed to a passphrase hash — no account, no email.
- **Filterable exportable feeds** that GCal auto-refreshes.

## The categories

- **sound** — concerts, sound art, opera
- **dance** — dance classes and shows
- **film** — screenings, workshops
- **tech** — hardware, generative visuals, live-coding
- **make** — book arts, darkroom, printmaking, woodworking
- **stage** — performance art, theatre
- **word** — readings, writing groups
- **circle** — communal meals, meditations, social practice

## What Art Cal is not

- **Not a listings site.** It's a curated personal map, not a scraped aggregator.
- **Not a social product.** The picks-sync is one person's picks shared across their own devices. No feed, other people, or sharing links.
- **Not automated.** New events go in by editing a JSON in a GitHub web editor. No scraping cron, no email-parsing pipeline (for now).

## How it's specific to me

The tech build is generic; what's included in the calendar is a reflection of my personal practice and preferences.

Fork the code, rewrite the JSON.

## How it's built

- **Vite + React + TypeScript**, strict mode, no CSS framework — hand-written stylesheet on CSS custom properties.
- **All events in JSON** — `src/data/events.json`, `spaces.json`, `fall.json`. I edit these directly in GitHub's web editor and commit — no admin UI, no forms.
- **Supabase for picks sync.** SHA-256 hash of a user-chosen passphrase is the row key. The passphrase is never sent to the server, only its hash. Nothing else is stored in the backend.
- **Build-time ICS generation.** A `tsx` script (`scripts/generate-feeds.ts`) runs after Vite build and emits three `.ics` files into `dist/`, served with `Content-Type: text/calendar` from Vercel via `vercel.json`.
- **Stable event UIDs** derived from date + slug of event name, so calendar apps update existing events instead of duplicating them on each refresh.
- **Today-aware everywhere.** Days-until countdowns on events, current-week highlight, past-event dimming — all keyed to `today()` at load.
- **Deployed on Vercel** with continuous deploy from `main`. Editing JSON on GitHub triggers a Vercel rebuild within a minute; GCal picks up feed changes on its next refresh (typically 12–24 hours).

## Scanning

A scheduled GitHub Action (`scripts/scan-events.ts`) sweeps the venue list in `scripts/scanner/venues.ts` and extracts upcoming events. It tries the cheapest, most reliable source first and only falls back when it must:

1. **Published iCal feeds** (`icsUrl` on a venue) — parsed directly, no LLM.
2. **JSON-LD** structured data on the listing page.
3. **Detail-page crawl** — follows event links to pages that carry JSON-LD even when the listing doesn't.
4. **Platform parsers** — server-rendered Squarespace event lists and WordPress "The Events Calendar" markup.
5. **LLM extraction** — last resort for JS-rendered venues with no structured data.

Every candidate passes gates (real future date present in source, title tokens present, valid category/mode) and a fuzzy dedupe check; dense performance runs collapse to one opening-night entry.

### No-pay LLM setup

Step 5 uses whichever free API key is present, preferring the largest free tier. Set **one** as a GitHub Actions secret:

- `GROQ_API_KEY` — [Groq](https://console.groq.com) free tier (thousands of requests/day; covers every LLM-needing venue each run). **Recommended.**
- `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` (+ optional `CEREBRAS_MODEL`, default `llama-3.3-70b`) — [Cerebras](https://cloud.cerebras.ai) free tier; a strong alternative if Groq signup is down.
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — Gemini free tier (~20 requests/day; venues rotate across runs via `scan-state.json`).
- `OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY` (+ optional `OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL`) — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, Together, …).

With no key set, steps 1–4 still run, so feed/JSON-LD/CMS venues keep updating for free.

## Editing

Any event or venue lives in `src/data/`. Edit in the GitHub web editor, click Commit — Vercel rebuilds automatically and your subscribed calendar reflects the change on its next refresh cycle.
