// The Practice model.
//
// Art Cal's original primitive was CalEvent: one date, one row. That model can
// only express things that publish a date, which in practice means ticketed
// shows. Making does not publish dates. It publishes standing patterns:
// "Mon/Wed/Fri 6:30-8pm", "first Saturdays", "8-week sessions", "$165/month".
// So the primitive here is the standing pattern, and "what's on this week" is
// COMPUTED from it rather than scraped.
//
// Two views share this one dataset:
//   Directory (public) — where to make things in NYC, all disciplines.
//   Commitments (private) — the <=5 practices actually being done, with
//   deadlines, budget, and finish lines.
